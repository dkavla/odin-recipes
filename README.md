# odin-recipes
First project utilizing HTML from TheOdinProject's Foundations course

The project will consist of only HTML and will have a main index page with various links to a few recepies. Its not meant to look appealing but rather display what I have learned with HTML thus far.

The recipes used in this small project include Lasagna, Chicken Nuggests, and Chocolate Chip Cookies. This is to keep it simple. 

The main index page simply holds the list of links to the three recipes. Each recipe page has a image showcasing the recipe, a description about it, the ingredients required to make the dish, and the instructions for actually making the dish.
